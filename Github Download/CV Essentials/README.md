### Chapter 5
- Facial Recognition

## Approach and Motivation
The course is foundational to anyone who wish to work with computer vision in Python. It covers some of the most common image processing routines, and have in-depth coverage on mathematical concepts present in the materials: 
- Math-first approach
- Tons of sample python scripts (.py)
    - 45+ python scripts from chapter 1 to 4 for plug-and-play experiments
- Multimedia (image illustrations, video explanation, quiz)
    - 57 image assets from chapter 1 to 4 for practical illustrations
    - 4 PDFs, and 4 HTMLs, one for each chapter
- Practical tips on real-world applications

The course's **only dependency** is `OpenCV`. Getting started is as easy as `pip install opencv-contrib-python` and you're set to go.

##### Question: What about deep learning libraries?

No; While using deep learning for images made for interesting topics, they are probably better suited as an altogether separate course series. This course series (tutorial series) focused on the **essentials of computer vision** and,
for pedagogical reasons, try not to be overly ambitious with the scope it intends to cover. 

There will be similarity in concepts and principles, as modern neural network architectures draw plenty of inspirations from "classical" computer vision techniques that predate it. By first learning how computer vision problems are solved, the student can compare that to the deep learning equivalent, which result in a more comprehensive appreciation of what deep learning offer to modern day computer scientists.

# Workshops
I conduct in-person lectures using the materials you find in this repository. These workshops are usually paid because there are upfront costs to afford a venue and crew. Not just any venue, but a learning environment that is fully equipped (audio, desks, charging points for everyone, massive screen projector, walking space fo teaching assistants, dinner). 

You can follow me [on LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/chansamuel/) to be updated about the latest workshops. I also make long-form programming tutorials and lessons on computer vision on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SamuelChan)
